Topic, Reflection, Rating, Questions, Feedback
Need for HCDS, Obvious need in the field - so far I have attended Winter Schools "Ethics in Neuroscience" and "Fairness in AI" - therefore I feel highly sensitised to these topics and curious to learn more, 10, So far more questions than answers :), The organisation of the course seemed a bit complicated; but I am glad that effort was put into detailed conceptual and procedural planning
Setting up the groups, It is a good idea to put people of different levels of experience together; it just felt that the threshold for "experience" vs. "inexperience" was somewhat arbitrary/based on the individual self-evaluation - i. e. all females in the course considered that they are inexperienced in DS - I wonder if it could be correlated with different self-evaluation tendencies of males vs. females, 6, -, See Reflection
Assignment 1, So far I have only worked with tabular data, so parsing was totally new to me, 10, -, The assignment provided a potentially useful and easily doable warm-up and taught some readily-applicable methods for data acquisition-
Writing Reflections, I was sceptical at first; but it actually feels validating, 10 , -, I am glad it is an individual and not a group exercise
