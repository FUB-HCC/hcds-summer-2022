#  Our Rules
## Gabriele Inciuraite, Emilio Kuhlmann, Anton Wille
1. Meet once a week at a fixed time to discuss progress/problems with assignments and the contents of lecture and tutorial (Monday 4PM)
2. Document everything we do so that everyone can stay up to date and get back in quickly even when things get stressful. (Document in git repo, additional communication via Signal Group/ Email)
3. When problems arise we want to communicate early and honestly with each other and work together to resolve  problems.
4. Work should be divided fairly and equally, but we will also show consideration if things don't work out perfectly.
5. Decisions are made democratically and consensus should be the goal wherever possible.
