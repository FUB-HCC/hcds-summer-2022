    "🐍 Python is a programming language that has gained considerable traction over the last years, in various contexts, including data science and the digital humanities. If you have never written any Python before, it would be useful for you to familiarize yourself with the language, its basic constructs and conventions. It is popular for its versatility and readability. Speaking of which…\n",

What you are looking at now is a text cell written in the markup language Markdown, further below you see code cells written in the programming language Python (note the light grey background), which contain computable code! When viewing the notebooks in Jupyter, you can double-click on any text cell to see its source.\n",

To be able to analyze the data, we have to turn the unstructured strings of symbols into a practical data structure of the DataFrame that we can work with. This process is commonly referred to as ‘parsing’. \n",

For example, you can load CSV data from a local file or from a web address. While the files typically indicate with the extension what format they have, URLs or APIs may not have these.

CSV files contain tabular data that can be viewed and edited in a spreadsheet software such as Excel. CSV stands for [comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), which seems to say it all: the data values are separated by commas and each row represents one item. However, there are also CSV files that use separators other than commas, such as tabs and semicolons. \n",
