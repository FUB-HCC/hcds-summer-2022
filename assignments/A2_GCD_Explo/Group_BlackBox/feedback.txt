So far I am very happy with this class. I find the lectures very interesting. It is different than other classes I had so far. The lecture focuses more on ethical aspects rather than programming. I find this very different to most other classes. 

The exercise is a very good addition to the lecture. It's a great help to reflect on the assignments and to ask for help or get some input.

The assignment are very well structured and easy to work on. The tasks are not too difficult or simple. It's a good start into data science. The reflection assignments are great to think about the topics that were introduced in class.

For the reflection assignment we both needed around 2-3h. The programming assignment roughly the same time.

Furthermore, I would like know if we could get some example exams so we can get an idea what to expect.
