The assignment builds upon the previous one i.e., data analysis and pre-processing which is in line with the incremental learning approach. However, I find tutorials quite monotonous with limited insights into the Human centered approach to data science. Tutorial should cover some well structured real life case studies exploring different facets of Data Science workflow to make it more productive and engaging.
