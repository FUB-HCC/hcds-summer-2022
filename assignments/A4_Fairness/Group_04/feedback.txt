The package was really very old, and unstable. It took a lot of time for us to correctly structure all the dependencies packages, later on to realise most of the structures are changed for Python 3.10
The Wiki was really well structured, and guided us well, but instead of asking us to implement 4 different algorithm, a Task with 1 Algorithm would have been better. Our focus more went on to implement the assignment rather than understanding the fundamentals of fairness and bias because of implementing the 4 Algorithms and the outdated packages.

More time could have been utilized in reading the papers, and the uses cases of fairness and bias instead of implementation.
