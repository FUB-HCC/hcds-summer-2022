    "#### What types of bias mitigation algorithm are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bias mitigation strategies for machine learning havebeen proposed in recent years. The different approaches can be divided in the following three distinct groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-processing\n",
    "Efficient bias mitigation starts at the data acquisition and processing phase since the source of the data and also the extraction methods can introduce unwanted bias. Therefore, a maximum of effort must be put into validating the integrity of the data source and in ensuring that the data collection process includes appropriate and reliable methods of measurement. Hence, algorithms which belong to the pre-processing family ensure that the input data is balanced and fair. This can be achieved by suppressing the protected attributes, by changing class labels of the data set, and by reweighting or resampling the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In-processing\n",
    "The second type of mitigation strategies comprises the in-processing algorithms. Here, undesired bias is directly mitigated during the training phase. A straightforward approach to achieve this goal is to integrate a fairness penalty directly in the loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Post-processing\n",
    "The final group of mitigation algorithms follows a post-processing approach. In this case, only the output of a trained classifier is modified. The advantage of post-processing algorithms is that fair classifiers are derived without the necessity of retraining the original model which may be time consuming or difficult to implement in production environments. However, this approach may have a negative effect on accuracy or could compromise any generalization acquired by the original classifier. "
