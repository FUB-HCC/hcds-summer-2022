This exercise was a lot better than the last one.
For one the framework is documented ok, and some of the examples they give are quite decent.
On the other hand, it is still quite frustrating to have to learn yet another framework that we will likely
not use again. The repo hasn't been updated significantly in years and could be considered abandoned.

Sometimes the results from LIME are hard to interpret and one has to do mental gymnastics to iron out the double negations.
As the professor noted, one must pay attention at what the results actually are, and not just blindly trust the results because they look nice.
On a side note even if we understand LIME's model, we don't really know how good these local approximations are and as such should take
the results with an extra pinch of salt. 
In general we consider the task to be appropriate for the course, and we worked a total of about ~10 hours on it.
